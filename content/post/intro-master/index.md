On this page, I'd like to introduce my master's thesis in English. The page also provides the answers to some frequently asked questions, translated from Chinese, under the video.

## Q&A

Q1: How to distinguish the charge exchange effect and the resonant scattering effect in SNR?

```yaml
For spherical SNR, RS will make the G-ratio higher from the edge region and lower from the inner region at the same time. Whereas CX only affects the region where it happens.
```


Q2: What we can see in the near future?
```yaml
The surface brightness and ratio distortion can be observed with Missions presently and shortly.
```
