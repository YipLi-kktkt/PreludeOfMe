abstract: Resonant scattering (RS) of X-ray line emission in supernova remnants (SNR) has a potential impact on estimating the physical properties. Here we present our Monte Carlo simulation results of X-ray resonant-line emission from SNR. We employ the physical conditions characterized by the Sedov–Taylor solution. The results include the line profiles, the surface brightness, the G-ratio of the O VII Heα triplet. We show that the RS effect of Cygnus Loop is non-negligible, and of Cas A, the SNR in ejecta-dominated phases, may have some apparent effects on the shocked ejecta observational properties of oxygen-resonant lines.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We conduct a set of MC simulations to investigate the impact of the RS effect on the soft X-ray resonant-line emission (typified by O VII Heα r) from SNRs. The spatial distribution of the physical conditions is characterized by the ST self-similar solution, and the basic parameters used for modeling are generally similar to those of Cygnus Loop.
