title = {A Monte Carlo Simulation on Resonant Scattering of X-Ray Line Emission in Supernova Remnants},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {Resonant scattering (RS) of X-ray line emission in supernova remnants (SNRs) may modify the observed line profiles and fluxes and has a potential impact on estimating the physical properties of the hot gas and hence on understanding the SNR physics, but has not been theoretically modeled ever. Here we present our Monte Carlo simulation of the RS effect on X-ray resonant-line emission, typified by the O vii Heα r line, from SNRs. We employ the physical conditions characterized by the Sedov–Taylor solution and some basic parameters similar to those in Cygnus Loop. We show that the impact of the RS effect is most significant near the edge of the remnant. The line profiles are predicted to be asymmetric because of different temperatures and photon production efficiencies of the expanding gas at different radii. We also predict the surface brightness of the line emission would decrease in the outer projected region but is slightly enhanced in the inner. The G-ratio of the O vii Heα  triplet can be effectively elevated by RS in the outer region. We show that the RS effect of the O vii Heα r line in the southwestern boundary region of Cygnus Loop is nonnegligible. The observed O vii G-ratio of ∼1.8 of the region could be achieved with RS taken into account for properly elevated O abundance from the previous estimates. Additional simulation performed for the SNRs in ejecta-dominated phases like Cas A shows that RS in the shocked ejecta may have some apparent effects on the observational properties of oxygen-resonant lines.}
