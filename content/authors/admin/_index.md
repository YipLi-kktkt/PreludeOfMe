## About Me

Hi, I am Yiping Li (李一平). I'm currently in a Gap year in Hangzhou, China, pursuing my PhD program. 

I completed my master's degree at Nanjing University in 2023. My goal is to be an astrophysicist to explore the universe. I interested _X-ray astrophysics_, _Spectral Analysis_ and _Numerical Simulation_ presently. I had developed a resonant scattering simulation code for supernova remnant during my Master's study.

<!-- She engages in improving academic skills as a mordern international astrophysicist, meanwhile in traveling, volunteering friend's workshop. -->
